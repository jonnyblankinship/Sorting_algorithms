Sorting Algorithm Visualization using Tkinter

This code is a Python program that visualizes sorting algorithms using the Tkinter GUI toolkit. The program generates a random list of numbers and sorts them using two different sorting algorithms: bubble sort and insertion sort.

Installation

To run this program, you must have Python installed on your machine. You can download and install Python from the official Python website. The program also requires the Tkinter library, which should be included in your Python installation.

Usage

To run the program, save the code to a Python file (e.g., sorting_visualization.py) and execute the file using Python. The program will open a new window containing a canvas where the sorting animation will be displayed, allowing you to clearly visualize how each algorithm sorts.
